The RDCOMServer.dll (need different name) is located in the top
directory of the installed RDCOMServer package.  One registers servers
to use this DLL.  You will need to have $R_HOME/bin in your path to
run any executable that loads this DLL.  Also, that DLL needs to find
the appropriate value of R_HOME so that it can find the packages, etc.
To do this, we put this information in the registry when we install
the package. To do this, run the registry.S script as

   Rterm --vanilla < registry.S
   


Tests & Examples:

There are some tests and examples in the package.
The normal.S file in the examples/ directory registers
a server with program id  "Normal". The files in 
in the tests/ directory illustrate how to create and 
call methods for that class from a variety of different
languages: Java, Perl, Visual Basic.
