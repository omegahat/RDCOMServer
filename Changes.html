<h1></h1>

<h2>Version 0.6-2</h2>
<dl>
 <dt>
 <li> Repaired the build process so that the .exe and .dll are
   included at the top-level.
 <dd>
</dl>

<h2>Version 0.6-1</h2>
<dl>
 <dt>
 <li> Exported SCOMIDispatch() function from the name space
  that was erroneously omitted in 0.6-0.
 <dd>
</dl>

<h2>Version 0.6-0</h2>
 <dl>
  <dt>
  <li> Pretty extensive testing of the RDCOMClient and RDCOMEvents
    packages and associated updates to this package.
  <dd>
 </dl>

<h2>Version 0.5-4</h2>
<dl>

 <dt>
 <li> DCOMVariantRef and sub-classes for handling references to DCOM VARIANT 
      objects. These are used in event handlers/callbacks as OUT parameters
      in which results are returned via the arguments.
 <dd> Facilities for getting and setting their values: getValueOf() and setValueOf().

 <dt>
 <li> getNativeServerClass() allows one to determine the C++ 
      class in use to represent the specific R DCOM server.
 <dd>

 <dt>
 <li> Functions to access the definition of a server instance.
 <dd> This allows one to inspect the "functions" used to implement
      a server instance at run-time. Also one can set new
      definitions at run-time. This is 
      convenient when debugging the code in place.
</dl>
<h2>Version 0.5-3</h2>
 <dl>
  <dt>
  <li> Building for R-2.1.* with some changes to the structures.
  <dd>
 </dl>

<h2>Version 0.5-2</h2>
 <dl> 
  <dt>
  <li> Rebuild binary for R-1.8.* and the new class representation.
  <dd>
  <dt>
  <li> options() are checked for RCOMClassFile 
       before the environment variable R_COM_CLASS_FILE
       in getCOMClassDefFileName() when looking for
       the name of the file that is used to store the
       COM class definitions exported from R.
  <dd> Suggested by David James.
 </dl>

<h2>Version 0.5-1</h2>
<dl>
 <dt>
 <li> Using the appropriate finalizer at the C-level to garbage collect
  COM servers created by R when the session terminates (normally).
 <dd>   Thanks to Luke Tierney for explaining the different finalizer
   registration mechanisms.

 <dt>
 <li> Fix the {} around the CLSID in more places for the user.
 <dd>
</dl>


<h2>Version 0.5-0</h2>
<dl>
 <dt> Moved the event material from RDCOMServer and RDCOMClient into RDCOMEvents. 
 <dd>
</dl>

<h2>Version 0.4-1</h2>
<dl>
 <dt>  More structured support for event servers, e.g. classes.
 <dd>
</dl>

<h2>Version 0.4-0</h2>
<dl>
 <dt> Basic support for event servers
 <dd>
</dl>


<h2>Version 0.3-4</h2>
<dl>
 <dt>
 <li> Support for strings by reference as arguments for servers.
 <dd>

 <dt>
 <li> Include the { } around the UUID given as an argument 
     to the EXE server.
 <dd>


</dl>


<h2>Version 0.3-3</h2>
<dl>
 <dt>
 <li> Collapse COM arrays converted to R lists into vectors
     if the elements are a) homogeneous and b) integer, numeric, logical or characters.
 <dd>
</dl>
<h2>Version 0.3-1</h2>
<dl>
 <dt>
  <li>  Fix the serialization of the COM objects to avoid the memory fault.
 <dd>
</dl>

<h2>Version 0.3-0</h2>

<dl>
 <dt>
  <li> Allow the definition to be specified as an RDA file 
    whose name is found in the CLSID\\uuid\\rda key in the
    Windows registry. Similarly, support for a profile source
    file for each class identifier which is run when the 
    class is resolved by S, which happens each time an object
    is requested. Currently gets called each time.
  <dd>

 </dl>
<h2>Version 0.2-1</h2>
<dl>
 <dt>
  <li>  Fix handling of COMIDispatch argument values. (Testing for NULL 
    preceeded this.)
 <dd>
</dl>


<h2>Version 0.2-0</h2>

<dl>
 <dt>
 <li> SCOMNamedFunction class and constructor for defining 
    COM classes in terms of function names.
 <dd>
</dl>

<h2>Version 0.1-1</h2>

<dl>
  <dt>
  <li>  Merged converter code with RDCOMClient
  <dd>
</dl>
