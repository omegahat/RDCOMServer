 <li> When I try to register a COM class from R, I get an error 
  about not being able to open the key CLSID.
  What's the problem?
 <dd>
   This occurs when R tries to add the class identifier to the
  Windows registry but does not have permission to write 
  in the registry. You need to have the appropriate privileges.

  <li> When I try to create a COM object in R from a client
   application (e.g. Perl, Python,...), I get error messages
   about missing DLLs. What this?
  <dd>
    You need to have the directory $R_HOME/bin  in your path
   so that the system can find the file R.dll. 
   R_HOME is the location where R was installed. Add this to your
   path in the appropriate manner for your environment,
   e.g. by right clicking on the My Computer icon and selecting
   its Properties entry and then the Advanced tab;
   if you are using a Unix-like shell (e.g. bash or tcsh), set
  the path there, e.g.
    export PATH=$R_HOME/bin:$PATH
 or
    set path= ($path $R_HOME/bin)

 
  <dt>
  <li> When I run an client that tries to create a COM object from R,
  I get the error message
<pre>
Error: R.DLL version does not match
</pre>
    Do you know what the problem is?   
  <dd>
   Yes, it is that system is finding a version of R.dll in your path
  that does not correspond to the version of R_HOME that is used
  to find the R packages.  When we load the R.dll, that is found in your path.
  When we find the R packages, we look either at the value of the R_HOME 
  environment variable, or we look in the registry to see if R_HOME has been
  registered.  The path and the location of R_HOME should agree.
